The provided code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to enhance its efficiency and readability.

**Improvements:**

1. **Reduce redundant code:** The `get_all_creds` method has multiple if conditions to check if a certain API key is set in the settings. Instead of repeating this logic for each API key, consider using a dictionary to map API key names to their corresponding credentials.

2. **Use list comprehensions:** In the `get_all_creds` method, the `all_credentials` list is appended with multiple credentials. This can be done more efficiently using list comprehensions.

3. **Avoid global variables:** The `DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` list is a global variable. Consider passing it as an argument to the methods that use it instead of accessing it globally.

4. **Use type hints:** While the code uses type hints in some places, there are a few places where they are missing (e.g., the `verify_state_token` method). Adding type hints can improve the code's readability and help catch type-related errors.

5. **Consider using a more efficient data structure:** The `get_creds_by_id` and `get_creds_by_provider` methods use list comprehensions to find credentials. This has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of credentials. If the number of credentials is large, consider using a dictionary to store credentials with their IDs or providers as keys.

Here's an updated version of the code incorporating these improvements:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from collections import defaultdict

class IntegrationCredentialsStore:
    def __init__(self):
        from backend.data.redis import get_redis

        self.locks = RedisKeyedMutex(get_redis())
        self.default_credentials_map = self._create_default_credentials_map()

    @property
    @thread_cached
    def db_manager(self) -> "DatabaseManager":
        from backend.executor.database import DatabaseManager
        from backend.util.service import get_service_client

        return get_service_client(DatabaseManager)

    def _create_default_credentials_map(self) -> dict:
        default_credentials_map = {
            "revid": revid_credentials,
            "ideogram": ideogram_credentials,
            "groq": groq_credentials,
            # Add other default credentials here...
        }
        return default_credentials_map

    def get_all_creds(self, user_id: str) -> List[Credentials]:
        users_credentials = self._get_user_integrations(user_id).credentials
        all_credentials = users_credentials + [ollama_credentials]
        all_credentials.extend(
            [
                creds
                for provider, creds in self.default_credentials_map.items()
                if getattr(settings.secrets, f"{provider}_api_key")
            ]
        )
        return all_credentials

    def get_creds_by_id(self, user_id: str, credentials_id: str) -> Optional[Credentials]:
        credentials_map = {creds.id: creds for creds in self.get_all_creds(user_id)}
        return credentials_map.get(credentials_id)

    def get_creds_by_provider(self, user_id: str, provider: str) -> List[Credentials]:
        return [creds for creds in self.get_all_creds(user_id) if creds.provider == provider]

    #... rest of the code...
```

**Note:** This is just an updated version of the code and might not be perfect. It's always a good idea to test the code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
